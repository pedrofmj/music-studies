# Pedro Performance Rig

This directory contains the portable authored definition of the first
Performance Rig. Schema version `music-studies/performance-rig/v1` uses JSON
Schema Draft 2020-12.

Current status: schema foundation only. No installer, service, runtime, or live
audio/MIDI tool reads this directory. The protected `setup.json`, Carla
project, services, and graph remain the production authority until the later
parity and cutover gates pass.

The six schemas are:

- `common.schema.json`: shared identifiers, selectors, capabilities, MIDI,
  ownership, readiness, takeover, state, and switch-safety types;
- `rig.schema.json`: the complete Rig catalogue and stable device slots;
- `rig-profile.schema.json`: one global composition;
- `device-profile.schema.json`: one role for one logical device slot;
- `hardware-preset.schema.json`: controller-local raw message assignments; and
- `switch-triggers.schema.json`: persistent management events translated to
  the same future switch operations as the CLI.

Top-level authored definitions contain semantic capabilities. Operating-system
paths, PipeWire/JACK port names, Carla parameter indices, Windows device IDs,
and service identifiers belong in platform bindings, which are not part of
this schema slice.

Run the offline schema suite from the repository root after installing the
authoring-only dependency:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r docs/tools/music-rig/requirements-schema.txt
python3 docs/tools/music-rig/validate-performance-rig.py --self-test
```
